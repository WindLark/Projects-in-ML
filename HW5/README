This directory is specifically for HW5.


Notes:
Google Colab has recently implemented stricter limits on GPU usage, which limited my ability to perform a more resource intensive
run with a large augmented dataset in Task 1 combined with ResNet. In order to obtain meaningful results with a reasonable span of time
I capped the ResNet model for task 1 part 3 at running for 10 epochs and have commented on this accordingly. This also
affected my ability to do some of the homework in general and I spent more time focusing on just getting models implemented
before usage restrictions limited my ability to complete the excercises in a reasonable time.

Because Task 2 features four relatively similar notebooks a short description has been provided in this README instead. 
Task 2 code attribution is primarily given to https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cvae and https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan which 
were the resources we were provided to complete the assignment. This repository includes a straightforward implementation of the tutorial for fashionMNIST,
and then a modified approach that attempts to implement a version that handles CIFAR but needs parameter adjustment and more training time.

Additional Resources for Task 2:

For task 2 I did the tutorials provided by Professor Uzma twice:

The first time I did a straightfoward implementation of the tutorials Professor Uzma provided with fashionMNIST to try and get a
better understanding of how to implement VAE in Tensorflow syntax, and then
tried to repeat the task using the CIFAR dataset to try and see if I could adjust the model and dataset properly
to make a VAE and GAN model on a dataset that did not have similar parameters to MNIST. Due to limited experience with
Tensorflow (my current focus has been on Pytorch as shown in the assignments) I focused mainly on making
modifications to the parameters and functions to ensure the model would run and generate images. 
My CIFAR results are not particularly accurate by qualitative standards;  there is inprovement from generic blurs, but   
it would likely need much more training and parameter adjustment 
I wanted to provide my fashionMNIST attempt at the tutorial to show that 
I have a general understanding of what the intended output of the VAE and GAN should look like.
